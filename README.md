# Wikipedia Foundations

> Following the first hyperlink in the main text of an English Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually leads to the Philosophy article. [Getting to Philosphy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy)

Wikipedia also maintains  a user-reviewed, albeit incomplete list of “Vital Articles”, which organize articles based on their perceived importance to the website, where articles are rated on a 1 to 5 scale, based on their overall importance to the site.

In this project, I aim to use this “Path to Philosophy metric” as a basis alongside the vital score to examine whether or not an article being closer to Philosophy is associated with a higher perceived importance, and therefore more foundational.
